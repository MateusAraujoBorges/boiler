The example
is based on a Boiler Control system where a Control unit operates a Sensor
and an Actuator to control the pressure of a steam boiler. A Database is used
as a repository to buffer Sensor information while the Control unit performs
calculations and sends commands to the Actuator.

O Boiler Control (Controle de Caldeira) possui uma unidade chamada Control que opera um Sensor e um Actuator para controlar a pressão de uma caldeira de vapor. Um Database é usado com repositório para bufferizar as informações de um Sensor enquanto a unidade Control realiza cálculos e envia comandos para o Actuator.

The language is a syntactic subset of the International Telecommunication
Union (ITU) standard for MSCs [ITU 1996]. A basic MSC (bMSC) describes
a finite interaction between a set of components (see Figure 1). Each vertical
arrow represents a component and is called an instance. Arrow must be horizontal
and represents messages, the arrow source on one instance corresponds
to a message output and its target on a different instance corresponds to a message input. We refer to message outputs and inputs as events. In addition,
we use the terms instance and component interchangeably. The formal definition
of bMSCs is presented below. Note that a message label uniquely identifies
the sending and receiving component.


For the Boiler Control system of Figure 4, an architecture model is one
which is the result of composing in parallel four LTSs: One with alphabet with
fpressure, on, offg modeling the Sensor component, another with alphabet fdata,
query, pressureg modeling the Database component, a third modeling the Control
component with alphabet fon, off, query, data, commandg and a fourth
model for the Actuator component with alphabet fcommandg. In addition, all
traces defined by the semantics of the MSC specification must be maximal
traces of the composition of these four LTSs.



TUdo começa com a inicialização do sistema

O "Control" ao receber uma mensagem de "start" ativa o sensor "Sensor"
Ao receber alguma "pressure" o "Sensor" envia os dados para o "Database"
